# Chatty - The React Version

Chatty is a simple chat service built using React and Firebase. You can visit a deployed version of React here at this firebase ![deployment](https://bloc-chat-react-c196e.firebaseapp.com/)

## Motivation

The intention for this version of Chatty as well as the Angular and AngularJS was to build a similar application using multiple different javascript frameworks and get a deeper understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. 

## Using this Project

While you can fork or clone this repo and use any of the code in it in your application, please make sure to use your own firebase project to store the data. This project was built using Create React App, after cloning if you want to run it locally, you can use ...

```
npm install
npm start
```

to start the development server
